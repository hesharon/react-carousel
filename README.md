# React Carousel

Simple React carousel. 

- Lightweight
- no external libraries
- Responsive
- Swipable on mobile
- Has bullet pagination
- Infinite scrolling, but I laid out the code for no infinite scrolling in components > carousel > index.js if you like

Go ahead and use the code for the carousel and edit it however you need for your use case. I put it here for my own purpose and for the community because it took me awhile to create this lightweight custom component. External libraries just contain too many features that I didn't need and makes it hard to work with.
